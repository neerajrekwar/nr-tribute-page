    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First,</strong> "...having a good start, not only do I fully intend to be the greatest architect who has yet lived, but fully
intend to be the greatest architect who will ever live. Yes, I intend to be the greatest architect of all time."
- Frank Lloyd Wright 1867-1959</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Second,</strong> Born in 1867 Wisconsin, Frank Lincoln Wright grew up in the comfort and influence of a Welsh heritage.

      <li>
        <strong>In 1887,</strong> In 1887, at the age of twenty, Frank Lloyd Wright, broke from the comfort of his childhood in Wisconsin
and moved to Chicago. Chicago during the late nineteenth century was an exciting place. The fire of 1871
destroyed most of the old city allowing for it to be rebuilt in the new industrial age. Skyscrapers were the
all the rage in architecture, using steel and glass to create "shrines" piercing the sky. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>--</strong> Using the Lloyd-Jones' philosophies of unity, truth, harmony, and simplicity; and Sullivan's approach of
"form follows function", Wright quickly built up a practice in residential architecture. At one point in his
career, Wright would produce 135 buildings in ten years. Patience, concentration, attention to detail, and
constant revision marked Frank Lloyd Wright's work in the studio; things that would be lacking in his
personal relationships.</li>

age to age, proceeds, persists, creates, according to the nature of man, and his
circumstances as they change. That is architecture - Frank Lloyd Wright, 1937"
